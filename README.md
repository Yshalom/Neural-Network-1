<h1>Neural-Network-1</h1>
<h2>This is a simple project who uses C# and OpenTK-OpenCL (for GPU calculations).</h2>

<p>This program builds and uses in Neural-Network to recognize number characters (0-9).
The Neural Network is built by the program and trained with the Back-Propagration algorithm.

* This project uses OpenTK and .Net 6.0 
  <u>In the project root file, there should be folders called 'picture_of_0', 'picture_of_1', ..., and 'picture_of_10'.
These folders aren't in this GitHub's repository due to their huge size.
Notice that this ANN got trained on this data and works with it in the code.</u>

In the below pictures, you can see several states from the program when it runs.
