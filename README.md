<h1>Neural-Network-1</h1>
<h2>This is a simple project who uses C# and OpenTK-OpenCL (for GPU calculations).</h2>

<p>This program builds and uses in Neural-Network to recognize number characters (0-9). </br>
The Neural Network is built by the program and trained with the Back-Propagration algorithm.  </br> </br>

* This project uses OpenTK and .Net 6.0  </br>
  <u>In the project root file, there should be folders called 'picture_of_0', 'picture_of_1', up to, 'picture_of_9'. </u>  </br>
These folders aren't in this GitHub's repository due to their huge size.  </br>
Notice that this ANN got trained on this data and works with it in the code.  </br>

In the below pictures, you can see several states from the program when it runs.
